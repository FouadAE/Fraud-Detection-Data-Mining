## Objective:
The project aims to provide schools with a comprehensive solution for analyzing student performance over time and implementing a fraud detection model to identify unusual grades based on historical progress, grades, activity, and other indicators.

## Components:

### Performance Analysis:

Explore trends in academic performance.
Utilize descriptive statistics, data visualization, and time series analysis to provide insights into students' learning trajectories.

### Fraud Detection:

Define anomalies and unusual grade patterns.
Develop a fraud detection model using machine learning or deep learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify irregularities.
